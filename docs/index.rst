Django Test Addons's documentation!
==============================================

**Django test addons** provides support for testing different databases along with
Django Web Framework. By default, django provides support for relational databases
only. Since no-sql database systems are being widely used in django community, testing
support for them is vital. As of now, django test addons provides testing support
for Mongodb, Redis, Neo4j, Memcache, Django Rest Framework APIs only. Support for more
databases might be provided in future.
